Hypercube.py defines the structure of a hypercube (see Definition 5).

alg1.py, alg2.py, alg3.py, and alg4.py implement the workflows corresponding to Algorithms 1–4, respectively.

success_bipan.py is designed to assess the fault-tolerant capability of Algorithm 4 when the number of faulty edges surpasses the theoretical fault-tolerance limit.
